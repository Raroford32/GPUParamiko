## Introduction
SSH_GPU is a Python-based SSH library that explores GPU acceleration as an alternative to Paramiko. It provides basic SSH functionality with a focus on leveraging GPU capabilities for improved performance in specific scenarios, particularly in cryptographic operations.

## Installation
To install SSH_GPU, you need to have CUDA and PyCUDA installed on your system. Then, you can install the library using pip:

```
pip install ssh_gpu
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary CUDA drivers and toolkit installed on your system before installing PyCUDA.

## Basic Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use SSH_GPU to connect to a remote server and execute a command:

```python
from ssh_gpu import SSHClient

def main():
    client = SSHClient()
    
    try:
        # Connect to the remote server
        client.connect('example.com', username='user', password='password')
        
        # Execute a command
        stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('ls -l')
        
        # Print the output
        print(stdout.read().decode())
        
        # Close the connection
        client.close()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Examples
Here's an example of how to use SSH_GPU for file transfer operations:

```python
from ssh_gpu import SSHClient

def progress(transferred, total):
    print(f"Transferred: {transferred}/{total}")

def main():
    client = SSHClient()
    
    try:
        # Connect to the remote server
        client.connect('example.com', username='user', password='password')
        
        # Open an SFTP session
        sftp = client.open_sftp()
        
        # Upload a file
        sftp.put('local_file.txt', '/remote/path/file.txt', callback=progress)
        
        # Download a file
        sftp.get('/remote/path/remote_file.txt', 'downloaded_file.txt', callback=progress)
        
        # Close the SFTP session and the connection
        sftp.close()
        client.close()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
